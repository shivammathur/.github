# Contributing to this project

## Contributor Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your bug fix or feature addition.
* Add tests for it, so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Send a pull request.

Please make sure that you have [set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really stupid in the commit history of a project.

Due to time constraints, you may not always get a quick response. Please do not take delays personally and feel free to remind.
